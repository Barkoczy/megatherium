# NestJS

#### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the Nest CLI. With npm installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

```bash
nest new server -g
```

Provide user the option to skip git initialization.
